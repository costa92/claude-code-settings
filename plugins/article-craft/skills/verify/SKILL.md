# Pre-Writing Verification

Verify links, commands, and tool features in batch before writing an article. Ensures all referenced tools and URLs are accurate. Non-blocking -- continues even when some checks fail.

**Invoke**: `/article-craft:verify`

---

## Inputs

- **Topic**: the article subject (e.g., "Docker container networking")
- **Tool names**: list of tools/projects the article will reference

If invoked standalone (not after `article-craft:requirements`), use AskQuestion to collect:
1. "What is the article topic?" (free-form text)
2. "Which tools/projects will the article reference?" (free-form text, comma-separated)

---

## Verification Modes

Choose a mode based on the article's purpose. Default is **Standard**.

| Mode | When to use | What it checks | Speed |
|------|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Fast** | Drafts, personal notes, time-pressured | Non-whitelisted tools only; skip link checks | ~60% of Standard |
| **Standard** | Published blog posts, tutorials (default) | Core tools + main links + code completeness | Baseline |
| **Strict** | Official docs, enterprise content | All tools (including whitelisted) + all links + sandbox tests | ~140% of Standard |

User can specify mode explicitly (e.g., "verify in strict mode") or it defaults to Standard.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Feature Discovery (tool/project articles only)

For each tool the article covers, discover its full feature surface. Skip this step for pure concept articles (e.g., "microservices architecture").

**Path A -- Tool is installed locally:**
```bash
# Check installation and scan all subcommands (one bash call)
which TOOL 2>/dev/null && TOOL --version && TOOL --help
```
Then for unfamiliar subcommands:
```bash
TOOL subcommand --help
```

**Path B -- Tool is NOT installed locally (prefer Docker):**
```bash
# Spin up a temporary container, run feature discovery, then clean up
docker run --rm TOOL-IMAGE:latest sh -c "TOOL --help && TOOL subcommand --help"
```

**Path B fallback -- No Docker available:**
```bash
# GitHub README (most authoritative feature overview)
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/ORG/REPO/readme" | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; print(base64.b64decode(json.load(sys.stdin)['content']).decode())" | head -100

# Official docs CLI reference
curl -s "https://docs.TOOL.com/cli" | sed 's/<[^>]*>/ /g' | tr -s ' \n' | head -80

# Recent releases
gh api repos/ORG/REPO/releases --jq '.[0:3][] | "\(.tag_name): \(.name)"'
```

**Priority**: local `--help` > Docker temp env > GitHub README > official docs > WebSearch

**All methods fail**: If a tool cannot be verified through any path (not installed, no Docker, GitHub/docs unreachable, WebSearch unavailable), do NOT silently skip. Instead:
1. Mark the tool as `UNVERIFIED` in the verification report
2. Warn the user: "Tool [X] could not be verified through any method. Claims about its features may be inaccurate."
3. Ask the user whether to proceed with unverified claims or remove the tool from the article

**Blog/Changelog scan** (always, if tool has an official blog):
```bash
curl -s "https://TOOL-WEBSITE.com/blog" | \
  sed 's/<[^>]*>/ /g' | tr -s ' \n' | \
  grep -i "new\|launch\|release\|feature" | head -10
```

After discovery, compile a feature checklist: known features vs. newly discovered features. New features must be included in the article outline.

### Step 2: Batch Link Verification (one bash call)

Verify all URLs in a single bash invocation. Use HEAD first, fall back to GET on 405/000.

```bash
for url in \
  "https://url1.com" \
  "https://url2.com" \
  "https://url3.com"; do
  code=$(curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 "$url")
  if [ "$code" = "405" ] || [ "$code" = "000" ]; then
    code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 "$url")
  fi
  [ "$code" != "200" ] && echo "FAIL $code $url"
done
# No output = all passed
```

**301 redirect handling:**
```bash
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{redirect_url}" --max-time 10 URL
# 301 → follow the redirect, use the final URL in the article
```

In **Fast** mode: skip this step entirely.
In **Standard** mode: verify main documentation links; skip known-good domains (docs.docker.com, github.com, etc.).
In **Strict** mode: verify every link including supplementary references.

### Step 3: Command Verification (chain dependent commands)

Verify commands the article will demonstrate. Chain dependent commands with `&&` in a single bash call:

```bash
# Example: verify uv workflow
cd /tmp && rm -rf test-proj && mkdir test-proj && cd test-proj && \
  uv init --name test && uv add requests && \
  uv run python -c "import requests; print(requests.__version__)" && \
  uv tree
```

Independent commands can be verified in parallel bash calls.

**Whitelisted tools** (see `~/.claude/plugins/article-craft/skills/verify/trusted-tools.md`): basic commands can be trusted without verification. Only verify niche flags, version-specific features, or deprecated commands.

**Non-whitelisted tools**: must be verified through official docs or sandbox execution. If a command cannot be verified, mark it `[needs verification]` or remove it.

### Step 4: Project Disambiguation

If WebSearch returns multiple projects with the same name:
```
Found 3 projects named "XYZ":
1. owner1/xyz (1.2k stars, actively maintained) - CLI tool
2. owner2/XYZ (500 stars, 6 months stale) - Web framework
3. owner3/xyz-tool (50 stars, personal project) - Python scripts

Which one did you mean?
```

Never assume which project the user means. Always ask.

## Output: Inline Verification Report

Report **only failures and pending items**. Passing checks produce no output.

```markdown
## Verification Results

### Failures
- [URL] returned 404, replaced with [new URL]
- [command X] not found in official docs, removed

### Pending (needs user input)
- [Tool Y] advanced config options could not be verified, marked [needs verification]

(If nothing failed: "All checks passed.")
```

**This report is non-blocking.** The article-craft pipeline continues even if some checks fail. Failures are noted in the report for the author to address.

---

## Enforcement Rules

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Fabricated command/feature | Reject -- do not include in article |
| Unverified claim | Ask user or omit |
| Unverifiable workflow step | Mark or remove |
| 404 link | Remove or replace |
| Questionable content | Ask user -- never guess |

---

## Verification Philosophy

All technical content must satisfy at least one of:
1. **Official docs verified** (most reliable) -- found via WebSearch/WebFetch
2. **Trusted tools whitelist** (pre-verified) -- see `~/.claude/plugins/article-craft/skills/verify/trusted-tools.md`
3. **User-provided info** (needs confirmation) -- user explicitly provided and confirmed
4. **Stable knowledge-base info** (moderate trust) -- fundamental CS concepts, standard protocols, classic algorithms

Content that satisfies none of the above: mark as `[needs verification]`, ask the user, or remove. **Never fabricate or guess.**

Trust levels:
- **Trust**: basic concepts, algorithm principles, language syntax, classic design patterns, standard protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP)
- **Verify**: specific commands, API calls, config file formats, version-specific features
- **Never trust without verification**: tools released after 2024, new version features, rapidly changing tech
